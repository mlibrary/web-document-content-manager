# Web Document Content Manager

The Web Document Content Manager is responsible for the authoring the content and metadata necessary to construct [Web Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) and entry to the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Using_the_W3C_DOM_Level_1_Core) or DOM. The DOM is used to generate an [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree), which is one necessary component to make our University of Michigan Library Web Documents [inclusive and affirming to all](https://www.lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility).
